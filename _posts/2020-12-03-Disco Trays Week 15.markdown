**Finalized CSV File Download**

Due to multiple failed attempts with the proper implementation of CSV file download, I need more time to work on the CSV file feature. This week, I tried creating a file on the file system, reading the data from the file system to memory, and building a CSV file to return for download. This implementation worked, but it took a while to figure out. 

Working on this task enabled me to improve my skill in looking up the right information on the internet and how to look at the most useful framework documentation information to complete a task.
