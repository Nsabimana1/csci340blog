**Challenges**
Find two different API's to connect was a difficult task. Most APIs seam good and adequate by themselves.
However, the process of making two different APIs interact with each other seamed rather almost impossible.
In order to get some work done, Eric and I decided to build a Meme generator. We decided to use a Random jokes and
Ramdom Pictures APIs. This allows use to generate a picture and a joke and then create a meme out of them.

**Process**
We were able to create appropriate HTM, CSS, and Javascript files and connected them together. It was exciting to be able
to click on a button and get a random picture with a joke written on it. Some memes seams to make sense while others do not.
The Khan Academy course was useful, but not very much because most of the Ajax code we had to write was straight forward.
However, we faced the problem of cors and it took us almost an hour figure it out.
