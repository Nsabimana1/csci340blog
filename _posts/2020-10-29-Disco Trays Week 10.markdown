**Integrating Identity Code with the Project**

This week, I integrated the code of resolving identity and the rest of the project. I created a new branch in which I wrote code to retrieve survey information for a specific user as provided by identity code. In addition, I attempted to run my local version of the project with the Azure database, but I could not run the project. I spent some time debugging this issue, and I still did not understand why my local computer could not connect to a remote database. 

Doing this task enabled me to learn more about connecting a local project to a remote database by configuring environmental variables. Moreover, I learned how to consume Dotnet session management code to retrieve user information of a signed-in user.
