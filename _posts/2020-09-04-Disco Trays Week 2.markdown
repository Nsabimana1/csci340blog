**Customising a Web Template for Disco Tray Studios Website**

For this week, I have been customising the the Disco Tray Studios website to reflect the fonts and colors as suggested by the graphic
Designer. 

After the template was approved, my team mate and I uploaded the project template to branch on the disco tray github account and started to make nessessary changes. On my side, I updated the projects section of the website, added a footer, a blog post, and restyled an email submission form. In addition, I worked with with Lucy while giving each other feed back and suggestions on how we could do better various components of the website we were working on.
