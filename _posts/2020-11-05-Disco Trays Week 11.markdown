**Repopulating Survey Page with data for update**

After demonstrating the project to the user, and receiving feedback about filling out the survey form with information after completing the survey, it was important to add this feature to the project. Thus, I worked on retrieving information from the database and use that information to repopulate the survey page for user to update a survey. 

Working on this feature helped me to understand the importance of hearing users' feedback during the development process. This is important because users can often provide insights about project usability that developers dot not catch often.
