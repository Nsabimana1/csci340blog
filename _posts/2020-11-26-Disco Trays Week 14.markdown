**CSV File Download**

This week, I started working on code for downloading a CSV file with all information for the Admin user. I spent time analyzing the structure of the information. I spent most of this time looking at how the mock file image looked like and imagined how I would query the database to get the information I wanted out that fits the desired format. I tried a few approaches but failed to download a CSV file. In addition, our local project branch was not working, so I spent some time debugging the issue and fixed the project back.
