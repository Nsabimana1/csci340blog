**Finalised Survey Update and Worked On Admin Page**

This week, I did more work on adding code to support survey update. This task got a little complicated because we were trying to write code that was general enough to support regular learning domains and TEC courses. Moreover, I started imaging the Admin page and added code to add links on the navbar that will direct the admin to the right information. 

Lastly, After fully implementing the survey update, I ad to marge my code with the come other team members were working on. Thus, I reviewed other people's code, merged their changes with my code, and committed collective code to the development branch.
