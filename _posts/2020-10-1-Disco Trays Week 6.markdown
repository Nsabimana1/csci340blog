**Integrating a sqlite database**

This week, I created a new dotnet core project for Hendrix Assessment. I confured the project and divided into into small components that team members will be working on. I added a library for housing models that corresponds to the database schema. In addition, I added a library for service layer which houses all code that brigde database and user interface code. 

More over, I intergrated an external sqlite database. In order to make this database work with the rest of the code, I added all necessary pachages such as entitry framework core, entity framework sqlite, and entity framework tools. In addition, I created models for database tables and ran migrations.
