**Description**

There are various web frameworks out there, and it is a challenge to determine which is the best. Bellow are the list of
web frameworks that we discussed in the class.

- Express
- Jungle
- Flask
- Laravel
- Ruby on rails
- ASP.net

 Express

After hearing from the class presentations and the team members who presented on Express Framework, I came to the conclusion
that it is one of the tools that can get the job done, but it is very difficult to install and work with. Some of the concepts
that are essential in web development such as routing, adding html, css, and javascript files seamed rather non trivial. Thus,
Express is probably not the best choice.

Jungle

Buy hearing from the presenting team, I feel confident and at easy to work with Jungle Framework. Despite the few challenges
that were presented about it, it seamed learnable and that one could get started with it and improve on it over time.

Flask

Like Jungle Framework, Flask is another python Framework. It is much simpler to setup. However, after hearing that some important
pieces such as database engine are not provided in the Framework by default, it would take more work to build a full blown web application.
Thus, even though Flask has some downsides, it is still a tool that one can consider.

Laravel

As bad as php is notoriously known to be, Laravel brings much simplicity to use PHP in web development. After hearing from presenting team
I got an impression that one can learn Laravel quickly and start using it. Despite the challenges of being difficult to set up, the availability
of a big community that is out there to help one fix problems along the way is a big advantage.  

Ruby On rails

Just like most presented frameworks, Ruby On Rails seamed easy to understand and setup. However, I heard that the programming Language Ruby is
a little difficult to comprehend at first. But once one gets used to it, it makes much sense. Thus, "Rugy On Rails" is another tool that is highly
considerable.

ASP.net

After all the above frameworks, ASP.net is by far the most usable Framework in my opinion. It's IDE, Microsoft Visual Studio, makes
development much easier and faster by helping one to add plugins and dependences very easily. In addition, the Entity Framework that
comes with asp.net allows database usage much easer by using object relational mapping. Thus, asp.net is my most favorable option.
