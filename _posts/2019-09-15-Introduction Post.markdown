At the beginning, the process of setting up this blog was going smoothly. I easily followed instructions to create a GitHub pages repository,
cloned it in my local folder, and installed Ruby.

However, when I attempted to create a Jekyll default project, I run the command `bundle install`, and I got an error message that said that "Could not locate Gemfile". I googled and spent more than two hours trying to fix that error, but I could not. Even though it did not help that much,
when I was trying to fix the error, I spent most of the time on the following web pages trying to find a solution at these links:

 - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329953/could-not-locate-gemfile)
 - [Forestry](https://forestry.io/docs/troubleshooting/could-not-locate-gemfile-or-bundle-directory/)

 Lucky, I met a classmate and asked him about the issue. He told me that he encountered a similar issue, but he emailed the professor for a solution. The professor told him to create a file and call it Gemfile, but do not give it any extension. When I tried this approach, it worked. After passing this error, I was able to follow the rest of steps and completed the blog without trouble.

I am very excited about how this blog will turn because I want to create and design a separate page that describes my programming experience and
use it as my personal website to submit to companies when I apply for internships and jobs.
