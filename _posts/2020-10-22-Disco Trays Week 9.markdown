**Implemented Survey Rendering And Basic Survey Submission**

This week, I implemented backend code for rendering survey page with real database code instead of dummy data. The code retrieved outcomes and options per servey, and I was able to pasist survey information into the database. In addition, Due to the complexity of rendering information already surveyed class, I met with Andrew to talk about perharps restructuring the database to make this usecase easier to implement. 

Doing this work helped me to understand potential missunderstanding that can happen before implementing a feature on a big system. A feature may seem straight forward before writting code, but when implementation starts there is always a possibility of redisigning system components such as database.
