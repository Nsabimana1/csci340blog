**Writting a basic web application with DotNet Razor Pages**

Starting with week 4, Disco trays team took a direction of learning tools that we will using to build a webapplication for Hendrix Assessment. Thus, I was appointed to investigate a dotnet framework and build a small demo that has simple use case so that we can see how dotnet will be effective for the tastk. 

I created an empty project, and customised it to had case of adding and displaying users on webpate. This project had a database with one table, and it was suffient to caputure the overal important component of the use case.
