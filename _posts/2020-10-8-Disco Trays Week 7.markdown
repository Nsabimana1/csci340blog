**Implementing SQL queries using Entity Framework Core**

This week our team made more progress on Hendrix assessment project. The main task for the week was to figure how we will querry the database and display information on the user interface as well as getting information from the form and store them into the database. 

After the team met in our Thursday meeting and discussed two possible queries we could run agains the database, I wrote C# code to implement the sql queries. In addition, I wrote html code to render the information on the Survey page.
