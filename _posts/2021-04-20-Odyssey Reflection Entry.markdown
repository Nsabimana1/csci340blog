**Reflecting on My experience working on My work With DiscoTray Studios**

Before joining Disco Tray Studios, I had just finished a software engineering internship with Acxiom. Given my passion for technology, after spending time writing code that maintains an already existing massive project, I was looking forward to improving my software development skills by taking a significant step in starting a new project from scratch and driving it to completion. Working for Disco tray studio did not only help me to build more confidence in my ability to use technology to impact the community, but it also helped me to identify specifics of the part of a software technology stack that I enjoy working on most. 

For instance, in the first two to three months, I helped build a website for Disco Tray studios. Spending time with another team member to brain ideas about the look and feel of the website and identifying a nice template to customize enabled me to learn more about the User experience and the design of a software system. I spend some time googling various Html tags to use on our website and did work on customizing CSS pages. Until this point, I often focused on writing backend code, but this project helped me to get at a taste of what it would be like to be a front-end developer. As a result, I realized that I enjoy writing backend code more than I do with frontend. 

Moreover, I had an opportunity to develop further skills working with Dot net technology. It was a great learning opportunity to learn how my peers write code. By observing how Andrew and Ivy structure their code and reading the style they use to write classes and functions, I was able to adopt new ways of writing code in c#. Lastly, disco tray studios helped me to practice more on teamwork. I learned a lot about reviewing the code of other people and handling misunderstand that could arise in deciding about feature design choices.
