**Added Survey page and Implemented Side Nav bar**

This week, I added survey page to display information that a teach see after opening the website. I am reimplemented the side navigation bar to render information about an individual class when it is clicked. In addition, after adding new tables and renaming some fields of some tables, I updated database models and ran new migrations. 

This task helped me to fully understand our database structure and think critically about how information is flowing across the project.
