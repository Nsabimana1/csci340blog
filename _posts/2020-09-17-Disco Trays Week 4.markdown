**Writting a basic web application with DotNetMVC**

During week 5, I recreated a dotnet demo project using RazorPages Pattern instead of MVC pattern. The project had one user class, and I implemented operations of adding a new user and displaying a list of all users. 

In addition, it became import to figure out if we could use an existing database and integrate it in a dotnet core project. Thus, I updated the DotNetRazorDemo project to load data from an external sqlite database. Doing this work helped me to refresh my skills in dotnet framework. In addition, it helped me to learn how to integrate an already existing database into an empty dotnet core project.
